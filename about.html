			<h1>We're Coder Inquisition!</h1>
			<p>This project was born between three game design students and a graphic designer at the Rochester Institute of Technology. We're pretty dedicated to getting jobs ourselves - that's why we started this service. 
			</p>
			<p>Don't worry though, this isn't just us. We have the support of industry professionals who were generous enough to offer their own tips and tricks, as well as provide some of the interview questions we explore in our videos. Feel free to have a look around, and don't be afraid to leave feedback on any of our social media or by email at CoderInquisition@gmail.com.
